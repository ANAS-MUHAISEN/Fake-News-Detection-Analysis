üì∞ Fake News Detection Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing and detecting fake news using Machine Learning techniques. It was implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and is based on a labeled dataset containing both real and fake news articles.

üß† Project Overview
The notebook walks through the full pipeline of a text classification task:

Data Importing: Loads a dataset of real and fake news.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performs initial analysis to understand the structure and distribution of the data.

Data Cleaning: Cleans the text by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, removing whitespace, and more.

Text Vectorization: Converts text into numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

Model Training: Trains several classifiers including:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Random Forest

Passive Aggressive Classifier

Model Evaluation: Uses metrics such as Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, and Recall to evaluate model performance.

üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

The following Python libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or install them manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
üìä Results
The Passive Aggressive Classifier showed the highest accuracy in detecting fake news.

Models demonstrated good performance in classifying fake vs real articles.
